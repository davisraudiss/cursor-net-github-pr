# Autonomous PR Orchestration with AI (Cursor + .NET)

Faster pull requests, without losing control.

## In one sentence
A practical blueprint for letting an AI assistant propose small, safe changes on GitHub pull requests—while humans stay fully in charge.

## Read the paper
- PDF: [`paper.pdf`](paper.pdf)

## Why this matters
- Save time on tiny, repetitive fixes.
- Keep changes small, focused, and easy to review.
- Use AI on your terms: human approval and clear guardrails.

## What’s inside
- A clear overview of how this works in real teams.
- The rules that keep it safe and auditable.
- A practical rollout checklist and incident playbook.
- A realistic example that shows the assistant’s role and limits.

## Who it’s for
- Engineering leaders who want speed and quality.
- Developer experience teams improving everyday flow.
- Security teams ensuring safe, governed adoption.

## How to use it
1) Skim the Executive Summary for the big picture.
2) Share the paper with your stakeholders and note what resonates.
3) Pick one repository and walk through the rollout checklist.

## What the AI does (and doesn’t)
- Does: propose small fixes with a brief explanation; keep changes focused.
- Doesn’t: merge code or make broad, risky edits—people decide, always.
